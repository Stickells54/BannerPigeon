        <ItemDescription Value="BannerPigeon adds a carrier pigeon mail system to Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord. Send letters to settlement owners and kingdom leaders from anywhere without traveling across the map. Perfect for diplomacy, recruitment, and managing your relationships with lords efficiently.

Features:
• Contact settlement owners and kingdom leaders remotely via carrier pigeon
• Realistic Travel Time: Optional distance-based delays (pigeons fly across the map!)
• Conversation Queue: Never miss a response - letters queue up if you are busy
• Settlement Support: Contact lords whether they are in a party or resting in a town
• Prisoner Checks: Smart validation prevents wasting pigeons on imprisoned lords
• Economy System: Gold cost is paid to the local settlement owner (if applicable)
• Full MCM (Mod Configuration Menu) integration for easy customization
• Save game compatible - uses proper save system serialization

MCM Settings:
• Pigeon Cost: Adjust gold required per message
• Response Time: Choose between fixed days or realistic distance-based travel
• Pigeon Speed: Fine-tune how fast pigeons fly when using realistic travel time
• Location Toggles: Enable/disable in towns or castles
• Notification Options: Control response arrival alerts

Perfect for players who want to streamline diplomacy, avoid endless map travel, and focus on strategy rather than chasing lords across Calradia.

Compatible with Bannerlord v1.3.X
Requires: Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) v5.10.2 or higher"/>
